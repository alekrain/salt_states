# Salt States
---
A collection of SaltStack states/formulas/playbooks and code that I use to manage systems.

I'm slowly going through to document all the states and code with README.md files, but as I'm still in the process of sanitizing and open sourcing most of the states and code I've written, it's likely that most don't yet have one. If you find that one doesn't it's likely that there are notes about usage at the top of any file. And with most states and code, I usually try to be pretty verbose with comments.
