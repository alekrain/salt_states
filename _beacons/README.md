# salt_beacons

These are a collection of "beacons" that are for use in an environment managed with SaltStack.<br>
Each has it's own purpose that should be apparent from the name.<br>
Each also has it's own set of required configuration data that I usually control through Pillar. The structure of this data is described in each individual beacon file.<br>
