# SaltStack Reactor File
#
# NAME: _reactors/pushover.sls
# WRITTEN BY: Alek Tant of SmartAlek Solutions
# DATE  : 2016.10.05
#
# PURPOSE: Send pushover alerts for events tagged with 'alert'
#
# NOTES: This file is managed by salt.
#


# There is no need to evaluate the tag as that is already handled by the
# reactor conf. Here we can just say what needs to be done with the event.

{#- There is a confusing blend of jinja going on here. The tgt is a jinja var
that is passed in when the state is rendered so it can create the file correctly
on the master. The raw tags allow the other two variables to remain jinja vars
so they can be used when the master is calling the reactor file.
